## Overview

**LAFAEK AI** is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to assist law enforcement authorities in Timor-Leste in tracking down stolen motorcycles and enhancing crime-solving efficiency. The project is currently in its early stages, having been developed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the TiDB Future App Hackathon 2024.

This repository contains the frontend code of the LAFAEK AI platform, which has been deployed on Vercel. The platform's main objective is to streamline the process of recovering stolen vehicles by leveraging AI and real-time data analytics.
