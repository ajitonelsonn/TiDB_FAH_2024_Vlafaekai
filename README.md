## More About LAFAEK AI

1. **Lafaek AI - Motorbike Detection and Plate Recognition System**  
   This repository details a system designed to detect motorbikes and recognize license plates, storing images in AWS S3 and saving the paths to a MySQL database. The system captures and saves images from CCTV footage along with metadata like location coordinates, timestamps, and confidence levels.

   Each record contains information such as the location (`longitude`, `latitude`), image paths (`full_image_path`, `motorbike_image_path`, `plate_image_path`), plate number, and detection confidence. This structured data helps authorities quickly access and analyze the necessary information. Explore the repository here: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ajitonelsonn/clip-tidb-image-embeddings).
